                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a
                    host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
                    environment to provide
                    programmatic control over them.
                    <br /><br />
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements
                    such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety
                    of purposes by
                    supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its Document Object Model
                        (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML
                        form and respond to user
                        events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li><br />
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript on a server. For
                        example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
                        continuity of information
                        from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h1>JavaScript and Java</h1>
                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript language
                    resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows
                    most Java expression
                    syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
                    from LiveScript to
                    JavaScript.
                    <br /><br />
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based
                    on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a
                    prototype-based
                    object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
                    dynamic
                    inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports
                    functions without any
                    special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed
                    methods.
                    <br /><br />
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                    classes, and
                    methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
                    you do not have to
                    implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                <h1>Hello world</h1>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                    JavaScript code:
                </p>
                <div class="code">

                        <br />greetMe("World");
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

        <section id="variables" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h1>Variables</h1>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform
                    to certain rules.
                    <br /><br />
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be
                    digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z"
                    (uppercase) and the
                    characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                    <br /><br />
                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode escape sequences
                    as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

            <header>
                <h1>Declaring variables</h1>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
                    <br /><br />With the keyword var. For example,
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        var x = 42.
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                    <br />
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        x = 42.
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use
                    this variant.
                    <br /><br />
                    With the keyword let. For example,
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        let y = 13.
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
            </header>
        </section>
        <section id="variable-scope" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h1>Variable scope</h1>
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is
                    available to any
                    other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a
                    local variable,
                    because it is available only within that function.
                    <br /><br />
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared
                    within a block is
                    local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
                    code will log 5,
                    because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
                    block, which in this case
                    is an if statement.
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                </div>
                <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
                        <br />not defined
                    </code>
                </div>
            </header>
        </section>
        <section id="global-variables" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h1>Global variables</h1>
                <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is
                    window, so you can set
                    and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
                    <br /><br />
                    Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or
                    frame by specifying
                    the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document,
                    you can refer to this
                    variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
                </p>

        <section id="constants" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h1>Constants</h1>
                <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant
                    identifier is the same as
                    for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain
                    alphabetic, numeric,
                    or underscore characters.</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                </div>
                <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It
                    has to be
                    initialized to a value.
                    <br /><br />
                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const
                    keyword is omitted, the
                    identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
                    <br /><br />
                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For
                    example:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
                        <br />WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
                        <br />//statements }
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without
                    problems.</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
                    <br />"otherValue";
                    </code>

                <h1>Data types</h1>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li><br />

                    <ul>
                        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is
                            not the same as Null, NULL,
                            or any other variant.</li><br />
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li><br />

                    with your
                    applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
                    think of objects as
                    named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>

            <header>
                <h1>if...else statement</h1>
                <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else
                    clause to execute a
                    statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
                </div>
                <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of
                    what evaluates to
                    true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is
                    executed. statement_1
                    and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.<br /><br />
                    You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence,
                    as follows:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
                        <br />statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
                        <br />statement_last; }</code>
                </div>
                <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be
                    executed. To execute
                    multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
                    to always use block
                    statements, especially when nesting if statements:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                    <br />statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                    <br />statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                    <br />statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code>
                </div>
                <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can
                    be confused with
                    equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
                </div>
                <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional
                    parentheses around
                    the assignment. For example:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
                </div>
            </header>
        </section>
        <section id="while-statement" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h1>while statement
                </h1>
                <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while
                    statement looks as
                    follows:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>while (condition) statement</code>
                </div>
                <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                    statement following
                    the loop.<br /><br />
                    The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true,
                    statement is executed
                    and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is
                    passed to the
                    statement following while.<br /><br />

                    To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those
                    statements.<br /><br />

                    Example:
                    The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x +=n; }</code>
                </div>
                <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the
                    following values:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li><br />
                    <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li><br />
                    <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n <strong>&gt;</strong> 3 is no longer true, so the
                    loop terminates. </p>

                <h1>Function declarations</h1>
                <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the
                    function keyword,
                    followed by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the function.</li><br />
                    <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li><br />
                    <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li><br />
                </ul>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
                </div>
                <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that
                    says to return the
                    argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the
                    value returned by
                    the function.</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>return number * number;</code>
                </div>
                <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the
                    function, but if
                    the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the
                    calling function.</p>
