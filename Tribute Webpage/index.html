                <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> is a
                47-year-old South
                African
                entrepreneur, investor, and inventor who has
                been fascinated with science and technology his entire life. His accolades include being the founder of
                SpaceX and
                co-founder of
                businesses such as Tesla, Paypal, and the Boring Company. Through his life as a man at the forefront of
                technological
                advancements, he has had many failings and critics along the way, particularly in the initial stages of
                his SpaceX
                project, from huge organizations such as NASA. Despite all this, his company managed to land a rocket
                booster
                vertically, for the first time, allowing boosters to be reused and revolutionizing the
                industry.<br><br>One
                leadership trait
                which is apparent is his vision, dedication, and perseverance. This means that, as a leader, he is
                laser-focused on the
                task at hand and is not phased by the possibility of failure due to having the
                desire and drive to do what he n eeds to do. An example of his drive and perseverance would be the fact
                that he was
                continuously investing and running Tesla through a long period of making losses. The reason for this is
                focused on the
                current
                objective and understands that it may not go smoothly at the initial stages but there are times when it
                is necessary
                to keep yourself and your people in the fight to reap the benefits later.
